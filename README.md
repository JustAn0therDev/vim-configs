# vim-configs
My vim (Neovim) configurations for plugins and .vimrc in case anybody that stumbles upon my GitHub profile is interested in VIM or already uses it 
and wants to checkout some different configurations.

### Configurations in the .vimrc file
The configurations in both files may not be necessary, but I keep them there just in case. Most of them create a pattern in tabbing spaces and indentation 
and exclude the .swp files that stay in the repository and have to be added to the .gitignore file.
