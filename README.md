# vim-configs
These are my VIM configs with some files to help me setup my VIM workflow fast on any machine.

Feel free to fork or just download the configs if something catches your eye. I'm always updating this repo whenever something in the config changes.

### To start:

Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). This will enable you to install all plugins listed in the `.vimrc` file.

Start up VIM (or restart if it was running) and run the `:PlugInstall` command. This should install all of the plugins without any issues.

### Currently:

I'm using Neovim now, so at least Neovim 0.5 must be installed.

### For Telescope:

For telescope, `sharkdp/fd` must be installed for it to work when looking for files. It can be installed using `apt` on Debian distros, and on `scoop` or `choco` on Windows.
